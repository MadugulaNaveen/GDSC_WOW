# Highlights Generator

### Project Overview

We are excited to present our project, **Video Highlights Extractor**, developed during the GDSC WOW hackathon hosted by the Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC). This project emerged as a solution to the challenge of sifting through lengthy videos to extract the most crucial moments, similar to how highlights of a cricket match are compiled. Our innovative approach earned us the 3rd prize in the competition.

### Problem Statement

In the era of abundant digital content, viewers often struggle with the task of finding the most interesting and important segments within long videos. Whether it's for sports, lectures, or any event coverage, manually creating highlight reels is time-consuming. Our project aims to automate this process, providing a seamless way to generate highlight videos.

### Solution

The **Highlights Genearator** leverages advanced video processing techniques to identify and extract key moments from lengthy videos. The extracted clips are then merged into a single, cohesive highlight video. This tool is designed to save time and effort while ensuring that viewers do not miss out on significant content.
